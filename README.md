# Design-and-Development-of-Automatic-Smart-Crop-Protection.
Agriculture is the backbone of food production, yet crops are frequently threatened by animal intrusions, causing significant damage and loss for farmers. Traditional methods like scarecrows, fences, and manual monitoring are often ineffective, labor-intensive, and costly. The need for a more reliable, automated solution is critical, particularly in remote areas where constant monitoring is not feasible. To address this, an automatic crop protection system is proposed, utilizing modern technology to safeguard crops from animal intrusion and reduce crop loss efficiently

This system is designed using an Arduino ATmega 2560 as the core controller and integrates a range of sensors including ultrasonic sensors for detecting nearby animals, PIR sensors for motion detection, MQ3 for fire detection and air quality monitoring, and a soil moisture sensor to assess soil conditions. A GSM module is incorporated to send real-time alerts to the farmer, enabling immediate action. Upon detecting animals or hazardous conditions, the system autonomously activates deterrents and alerts, offering continuous, cost-effective crop protection with minimal human intervention, significantly improving crop yield and reducing damage.
